## 🚀 Why This Model Stands Out
| Feature | Value to Employers |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Driver‑Level Granularity** | Captures every variable cost—from per‑drop fuel to incentive bonuses—so forecasts mirror reality. |
| **One‑Click Scenario Engine** | Macro‑driven controls let users stress‑test pessimistic, base, and aggressive cases instantly. |
| **Auto‑Generated Dashboards** | Sleek charts and KPI cards refresh on recalculation, perfect for board decks or investor pitches. |
| **Robust Sensitivity Tables** | Two‑way data tables reveal how a 1% change in churn or basket size ripples through net profit. |
| **Documentation & Audit Trail** | Transparent assumptions, clear labels, and color coding (blue = inputs, black = calcs) slash onboarding time. |

## 🛠️ Built With
- **Excel 365 / 2021** — advanced formulas (XLOOKUP, LET, LAMBDA), data tables, slicers  
- **VBA** — event‑driven macros for scenario toggles  
- **Power Query** — automated data ingest for historical orders and rider shifts  
- **Power Pivot & DAX** — model‑level measures powering interactive dashboards

## 🔍 Key Insights Unlocked
1. **Real‑Time Profitability** — Identify the order‑volume threshold where contribution margin flips positive.  
2. **Pricing Power** — Quantify the EBITDA lift from a 0.5 pp increase in platform commission.  
3. **Rider Incentive ROI** — Reveal whether surge bonuses actually expand margin or merely mask inefficiencies.  
4. **Cash‑Runway Forecast** — Integrate financing rounds and burn‑rate scenarios to flag liquidity crunch months ahead.
